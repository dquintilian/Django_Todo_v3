# Django_Todo_v3

this is an app I created while following a tutorial. Venturing into learning how django works 

More adventure awaits to create django stuff

Lastly to start the app I used anaconda 3.7 virtual env and then django latest , then pulling from the github
file for this repo to finish things off

use pip to install django 

use  python manage.py runserver to start things up
